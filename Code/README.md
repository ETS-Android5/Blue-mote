# All arduino code lives here
Note: As of 2021-09-09 all of this code is legacy

remoteRover and miniJeep are two robots I built for testing the controller on. I wanted to upgrade the smaller remoteRover but I never got to it and its sitting disassembled for the time being. A lot more testing was done on miniJeep so the code there is more interesting. remoteControl is obviously just the physical remote.

A note about minijeep, it was a power wheels car, the kind of electric car parents buy for their kids. Someone was throwing it out if you can believe it, all it needed was a new battery. After that I made it remote control but thatâ€™s a story for another read me.
