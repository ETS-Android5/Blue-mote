# All arduino code lives here
Note: As of 2021-09-09 all of this code is legacy

remoteRover and miniJeep are two robots I built for testing the controller on. I wanted to upgrade the smaller remoteRover but I never got to it and its sitting dissasembled for the time beign. Alot more testing was done on miniJeep so the code there is more intresting. remoteControl is obviously just the physical remote.

A note about miniJeep, it was a power wheels car, the kind of electric car partents buy for thier kids. Somone was throwing it out if you can belive it, all it needed was a new battery. After that I made it remote control but thats a story for another read me.
