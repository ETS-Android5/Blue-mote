Very first working version of the bluetooth app.

Used digital button inputs to emulate the message frame that minijeep3 was receiving (check out moveOverRover/Blue-mote/code for more details).

UI was not great and everything was on a realtive layout, But it did work however and it taught me alot.

The next version improved on alot of the short commings of this such as analog imputs and better UI.
