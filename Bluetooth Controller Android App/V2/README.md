# V2
Very first working version of the Bluetooth app. Used digital button inputs to emulate the message frame that miniJeep3 was receiving (check out moveOverRover/Blue-mote/code for more details).UI was not great, and everything was on a relative layout But it did work however and it taught me a lot. The next version improved on a lot of the short comings of this such as analog inputs and better UI.
