This version adds 2 analog imputs becuase of the digital joystick.

This implementation of the joystick was not perfect.
I had trouble offseting the sprite of the joystick from the postion of the finger becuase the cooridantes of the sprite start at the top left corner of the sprite not the middle.
Some strange looking offsets had to made becuase of this and it interfeared with the way I would map the position of the joystick to its actual value.

Other than that pretty similar to V2.
I did clean up the UI and switched it to a realtive layout. I Also impletment some new features like toasts and an option to set the origin of the joystick anywhere onthe screen.
Because of these changes this version of the app should* fit on any phone screen unlike the last one.
We are still using the miniJeep3 message frame as well.
